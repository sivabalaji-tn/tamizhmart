## 🚀 Installation (XAMPP / Local)

### Step 1 — Place files
```bash
C:/xampp/htdocs/Tamizhmart/
# Mac/Linux:
/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/Tamizhmart/
```

### Step 2 — Create the database
1. Open **phpMyAdmin** → `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
2. Create a new database named `Tamizhmart_db`
3. Select it → **Import** → upload `Tamizhmart_schema.sql` → **Go**

### Step 3 — Configure database connection
Edit `config/db.php`:
```php
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_USER', 'root');      // your MySQL username
define('DB_PASS', '');          // blank for XAMPP default
define('DB_NAME', 'Tamizhmart_db');
```

### Step 4 — Create upload folders
```bash
mkdir -p assets/uploads/logos
mkdir -p assets/uploads/banners
mkdir -p assets/uploads/products
mkdir -p assets/uploads/popups
mkdir -p assets/icons
```
Or on Windows, right-click → New Folder. You know how it works. 😄

### Step 5 — PWA Icons (optional but recommended)
1. Go to https://realfavicongenerator.net
2. Upload a 512×512 PNG logo
3. Copy icons to `assets/icons/` named: `icon-72.png`, `icon-96.png`, `icon-128.png`, `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`

### Step 6 — Launch!
```
http://localhost/Tamizhmart/
```
🎉 If it works on the first try, you're either very lucky or a genius.

## 🎨 Dynamic Theme System

Each shop has its own theme stored in the database. The owner picks colors in the dashboard and the entire storefront updates instantly — no redeploy, no cache clear, no crying.

```css
:root {
  --primary:   [owner picked this];
  --secondary: [and this];
  --bg:        [and this];
  --text:      [even this];
}
```

## 📱 PWA Setup

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Web App Manifest | ✅ Dynamic per shop |
| Service Worker | ✅ `sw.js` at root |
| Offline Page | ✅ `offline.php` |
| Install Banner | ✅ Auto-shown after 4s |
| iOS Meta Tags | ✅ apple-mobile-web-app |
| Push Notifications | 🔧 Scaffold ready |
| Background Sync | 🔧 Scaffold ready |

> ⚠️ Service workers need HTTPS in production. On localhost they work fine. Don't blame the code if your hosting has no SSL — just get a free Let's Encrypt cert.

---

## 🔒 Security

- Prepared statements everywhere — SQL injection is not welcome here
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt — not MD5, we're not living in 2008
- Session-based auth with `shop_id` binding — one shop can't peek at another
- File uploads validated by type + size — you can't upload a `.php` disguised as a `.jpg`
- `.htaccess` blocks direct access to config, SQL dumps, and `.env`

---

## 🛠️ Rename the Root Folder

Want to rename `Tamizhmart` to something else? Only 3 files need updating — `sw.js`, `pwa.js`, and `.htaccess`. Everything else uses relative paths and is completely safe.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Blank page | Add `ini_set('display_errors',1);` to `config/db.php` |
| Images not uploading | `chmod 755 assets/uploads/*` |
| Can't login | Clear browser cookies/session. Classic. |
| DB error | Check credentials in `config/db.php` |
| Service worker broken | Needs HTTPS in production |
| Fonts not loading | You're offline or Google is having a bad day |
| Everything is broken | Deep breath. Check error log. You got this. 💪 |

---

## 📦 Database Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `owners` | Shop administrator accounts |
| `shops` | One shop per owner — name, slug, theme, logo, banner |
| `shop_settings` | Key-value store for social links, phone, setup status |
| `users` | Customer accounts (scoped per shop) |
| `categories` | Product categories |
| `products` | Products with pricing, stock, images |
| `cart` | Active shopping cart |
| `orders` | Placed orders with status and total |
| `order_items` | Line items per order |
| `popups` | Scheduled promotional popups |

---

## 🚢 Deploying to Production

1. Upload files via cPanel / FTP / Git
2. Create MySQL database and import `Tamizhmart_schema.sql`
3. Update `config/db.php` with production credentials
4. Enable HTTPS — Let's Encrypt via cPanel is free, no excuses
5. Update `RewriteBase` in `.htaccess` if not at root
6. `chmod 755 assets/uploads/*`
7. Update PWA scope in `sw.js` if folder name changed
